# patternify-bot

Just a silly Telegram bot to learn Rust.

## What does it do?

It hides all of the letters which are not the part of user-provided pattern behind the spoiler, so it looks like this:

## How to use it?

The bot is available at [@PatternifyBot](https://t.me/PatternifyBot).

You can use it:
- by using a command with pattern and text: `/patternify <pattern without spaces> <text>`
- by replying on a message with a pattern: `/patternify <pattern>`
- in inline mode: `@PatternifyBot <pattern without spaces> <text>`
